Hi வணக்கம் ! I am a PhD student at MIT Media Lab, where I work in the <a href="https://www.ccc.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Center for Constructive Communication</a> (formerly <a href="https://socialmachines.org/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Social Machines</a>) group with <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dkroy/overview/" target="_blank">Deb Roy</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. Mainly, I’m interested in exploring different learning techniques to improve natural language understanding and empower AI systems to better model, characterize, understand, and reason about human behavior.

In this direction, my research has focused on developing computational approaches that: (a) embody knowledge about human social behavior to capture aspects of social cognitive processes like inferring personality traits or mental states, lifelong representation learning, narrative comprehension, etc. (b) study user behavior on social media to characterize on-going real-life phenomena like elections, political polarization, social media hate, casteist narratives, to list a few.
